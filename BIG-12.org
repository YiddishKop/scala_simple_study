* Big data and Spark

  MapReduce was an appraoch to dealing with very large data sets, MapReduce aimed at the enviroment make up by clusters of computers.And should *resilient* against that I have to be recover from the situtation when some computers down at some time. That is the way the MapReduce algorithm work:

  - do some processing
  - save the results off
  - do more processing based on the results
  - save the results off


  There is a big drawbacks that in hadoop, everytime doing the reduce, it saves the results off to *disk*, and this has a huge influence to the computation speed.

  This is where SPARK comes in. SPARK does a lot more of its operations in memory. It's still distributed, still has to do communication across the network. BUUUT, SPARK *doesn't save very ofen*, the way that it does this is through *RDD* (resilient distributed data set).

  They both should deal with the same problem, that computer will down, but SPARK deals with it in a *fundamentally different* way than HADOOP, and still allows us to do the majority of our operations in the memory, and only go out to memory occasionally.

* Run code on Spark

  SPARK shell
  -----------
  #+NAME: start spark-shell by some parameters
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    spark-shell --master local[*]
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Spark context Web UI available at http://192.168.199.134:4040
  *Spark context* available as '*sc*' (master = local[*], app id = local-1525585118689).
  *Spark session* available as '*spark*'.
  #+END_QUOTE

  1. --master : master node
  2. local : local mode
  3. [*] : use threads or CPU cores as many as possible.


  Then we can do some computation like:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    scala> sc.textFile("MN212142_9392.csv")
    res0: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[String] = MN212142_9392.csv MapPartitionsRDD[1] at textFile at <console>:25

    scala> res0.take(5)
    res1: Array[String] = Array(
      "Day  ,JD  ,Month  ,State_id  ,Year  ,PRCP (in),SNOW (in),TAVE (F),TMAX (F),TMIN (F) ", "1,335,12,'212142',1895,0,0,12,26,-2 ",

      "4,338,12,'212142',1895,0,0,2,12,-9 ")
  #+END_SRC


  SPARK program
  ------------
  some codes on local, like regular codes in eclipse or emacs


  SPARK submit
  ------------
  - setup your own spark context
  - setup a cluster by fat JARs using sbt-assembly, exporting a fat JARs
  - addSbtPlugin ~sbt-assembly~ to the Project/assembly.sbt
  - using spark-commit --class ??? target/scala ??? to run those things

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  spark-submit --master local[*] -- class ??? target/scala ???
  #+END_SRC

* Spark RDDs
  The use of RDDs has declined with the rise of SPARK SQL, data sets and data frames are kind of used more commonly in SPARK, but RDDs is still helpful to know what's underneath the hood.


  process:
  |    | var   | type         | hwo to get                                    |
  |----+-------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------|
  | 1. | conf  | SparkConf    | new SparkConf .-> set app name .-> set master |
  | 2. | sc    | SparkContext | new SparkContext <- conf                      |
  | 3. | lines | RDD[String]  | sc.textFile <- parth                          |
  |    |       |              |                                               |


  lines as an RDD follow somewhat different rules than scala collection.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Read a text file from HDFS, a local file system (available on all nodes), or any Hadoop-supported file system URI, and return it as an RDD of Strings.
  #+END_QUOTE


  ~RDD[A]~ is a Monad that support ~map,filter,fold,reduce,flatMap,aggregate~, looks like the collection of scala, but they're huge different under the neath.

  From this point of view, *RDD* is a *special collection*

  Just compare:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    // lines is Iterator[String]
    val lines = source.getLines().drop(1)

    // lines is RDD[String]
    val lines = sc.textFile("MN212142_9392.csv").filter(!_.contains("Day"))
  #+END_SRC

* More about RDD, Transform and Action
  RDD has 2 separate types of API methods on them:
**  1. give back OTHER RDD, map,filter,flatMap
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   ~def map[U](f: (T) ⇒ U)(implicit arg0: ClassTag[U]): RDD[U]~
   ~def collect[U](f: PartialFunction[T, U])(implicit arg0: ClassTag[U]): RDD[U]~
   Return an RDD that contains all matching values by applying f.
  #+END_QUOTE



  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *All* the operations on the scala *collections* were *Eager*, means return you result as soon as you called them.
  #+END_QUOTE

  Transform
  ---------
  For map of RDD, what it does is transform from one ~Monad~ to another ~Monad~, and in scala this is called *Transform*, and *Transform are lazy*,

  Actually, Transform *is more like a function* than an object, it *ONLY save the recipe*, NOT do it in practice. SPARK transforms are all lazy, so simply calls them will have nothing happen. *This just schedules some code to be run out across the cluster*, it doesn't actually happend until there is an *action*.

  which means that:
  |        | collection            | RDD                |
  |--------+-----------------------+--------------------|
  | filter | eager -> inefficiency | lazy -> efficiency |
  | map    | eager                 | lazy               |


** more about ~collect~
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   there two collect() method of RDD: one is a *Transform*, the other is an *Action*
   // Transform
   def collect[U](f: PartialFunction[T, U])(implicit arg0: ClassTag[U]): RDD[U]
   Return an RDD that contains all matching values by applying f.
   // Action
   def collect(): Array[T]
   Return an array that contains all of the elements in this RDD.
   #+END_QUOTE

  *the ~def collect()~ is used to capture all data from other machines(you know RDD may store his data into many machines, so every RDD include build by Transform, all may store in many machines) into master( current machine )*

  *when you do some operation(like sort, plot) in master computer, which require the whole data of some RDD, you should do ~thisRDD.collect()~ to collect all data from other computers, ONLY AFTER THAT, you can do this operation.*

  *the ~def collect(pf)~ acts like it in scala.collection*
** IMPORTANT NOTE about Transform
   Two features of *Transform* when it acts like a function, that is the reson why RDD is core concept of SPAR
   1. because it is (almost)a function, you can pass it to other functions, even to other machines, which make computation move around between computers.

   2. because it is (almost)a function, it's some like *pass by-name*, means whenever its name occur, it will do compute once, it's *not a pass by-value*. More occurance, More times it computes. Huge inefficiency.

   #+BEGIN_SRC scala
     // RDD[TempData]
     val data = lines.flatMap { line => ...}
   #+END_SRC

   eveytime 'data' occur, it will do lines.flatMap one more time:

   #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    println("=============================" + data.max()(Ordering.by(_.tmax)))
    println("=============================" + data.reduce((td1, td2) => if(td1.tmax >= td2.tmax) td1 else td2))
    val maxTemp = data.map(_.tmax).max
    val hotDays = data.filter(_.tmax == maxTemp)
   #+END_SRC

**  2. give back sth not a RDD
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     ~def take(num: Int): Array[T]~
     ~def collect(): Array[T]~ // different from the collect(pf)
     Return an array that contains all of the elements in this RDD.
     collect() is a method convert an RDD to an Array, very useful
     #+END_QUOTE

     Action
     ------
     Action are the methods of Spark that don't return other RDD, Action force some level of computation to actually occur.

  #+BEGIN_SRC scala

      if (p(7)=="."||p(8)=="." || p(9)==".") Seq.empty else
                                                         Seq(TempData(p(0).toInt,
                                                                      p(1).toInt,

                                                                      TempData.toDoubleOrNeg(p(6)),

    }
  #+END_SRC

  Very Inefficient.

  Why? Because of the Lazy Transform is (almost)a function, everytime it occur,one more time it computes, it's not a value.

  So, if you use some RDD more often, you should have more technique to deal with it.

  *cache*
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    def cache(): RDD.this.type
      //Persist this RDD with the default storage level (MEMORY_ONLY).
  #+END_SRC
  cache persist this RDD inside of memory.

  *persist*
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    def persist(): RDD.this.type
      // Persist this RDD with the default storage level (MEMORY_ONLY).

    def persist(newLevel: StorageLevel): RDD.this.type
      // Set this RDD's storage level to persist its values across operations after the first time it is computed.
  #+END_SRC
  persist can choose the ~StorageLevel~

  #+NAME: StorageLevel -> org.apache.spark.storage
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    val DISK_ONLY: StorageLevel

* Lazy filter and Eager filter

  all operations in scala collection are EAGER, it will immediately return; transform in RDD are lazy, it will just *compute in brain not in paper*.
